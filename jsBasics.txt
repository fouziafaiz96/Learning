DOMContentLoaded : signifies that the HTML body is completely loaded and parsed

The constructs that listen out for the event happening are called event listeners, 
and the blocks of code that run in response to the event firing are called event handlers.

Note: In JavaScript, all code instructions should end with a semi-colon (;) â€” your code may work correctly for single lines,
 but probably won't when you are writing multiple lines of code together. Try to get into the habit of including it.

basic idea behind Redux: a single centralized place to contain the global state in your application, 
and specific patterns to follow when updating that state to make the code predictable.


you can think of an action as an event that describes something that happened in the application.
