DOMContentLoaded : signifies that the HTML body is completely loaded and parsed

The constructs that listen out for the event happening are called event listeners, 
and the blocks of code that run in response to the event firing are called event handlers.

 but probably won't when you are writing multiple lines of code together. Try to get into the habit of including it.
